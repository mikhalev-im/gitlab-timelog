# GitLab timelogs

The app shows you the time tracked in your selected gitlab project in the given
time range per user.

## GitLab accesstoken

To use the app you need a gitlab token with `api` scope (`read_api` could be
enough as well). If you don't have it yet, it can be created
[here](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens).
